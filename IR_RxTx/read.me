These two files are revised-4-Andy from IRSendRcv (https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/IRSendRev.git).

They require IRSendRcv.h (amongst other files probably like the .cpp and .h that appear in the fork we made - see Andy_Org homepage on GitHub).

Also, learn more about .h and .cpp files and how to create/include them!!!
