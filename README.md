# Andy
Files for Project Andy

*********

I have tested each Sub-System of Project Andy. As result, I have a number of Sketches that govern each of these sub-systems to my satisfaction. However, I need to create a single sketch that will govern the entire Andy hardware (OS) and run the Andy Game (App). 

As such, I will start by uploading all the currently working sub-system Sketches here - which gives me a unified repository of all systems working individually. I will then attempt to integrate all the sketches into a single sketch (good luck to me LOL).

Does this link (to IR Rx/Tx) work? https://github.com/Andy-Org/Andy/tree/master/IR_RxTx
