Using the PCM.h Library

And apparently THREE freaking PWM pins (speaker on Pin 3, disables 3, 9, and 11), you can get real low quality sound from a small speaker by putting raw 8bit data of an audio clip into an array. Very simple, but resource-consuming!

MUST FIND A BETTER SOLUTION AS WE NEEEEEEEEED sound on Andy!!!
