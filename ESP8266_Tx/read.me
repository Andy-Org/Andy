This sketch uses the ESP8266 to ping my ThingSpeak account and register a number there.

As you know, I'v had the MOST issues w/this device. Use this code to create the main sketch. 

Remember that you need to modify the following things for this sketch:

- SoftwareSerial Lib (Rx/Tx on 10/11)
- My ThingSpeak Key
- My WiFi username/password
